# React Native Todo

## Design decisions

- Use React Native CLI instead of Expo CLI
- Use npm instead of Yarn
- Use Prettier as code formatter
- Keep dependencies at minimum

## How to run?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crudful/react-native-todo.git
cd react-native-todo/
npm install
CFACCESSKEY=ACCESS_KEY_FROM_ACCOUNT_PAGE npx react-native start
# open another terminal in `react-native-todo` directory
npx react-native run-android
```
